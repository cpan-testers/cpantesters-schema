# ABSTRACT: A single test report reduced to a simple pass/fail

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $release_stats = $schema->resultset( 'ReleaseStat' )->search({
        dist => 'My-Dist',
        version => '1.001',
    });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This table contains information about individual reports, reduced to
a pass/fail.

These stats are built from the `cpanstats` table
(L<CPAN::Testers::Schema::Result::Stats>), and collected and combined
into the `release_summary` table
(L<CPAN::Testers::Schema::Result::Release>).

B<XXX>: This intermediate table between a report and the release summary
does not seem necessary and if we can remove it, we should.
