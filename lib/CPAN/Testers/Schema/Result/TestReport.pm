# ABSTRACT: Raw reports as JSON documents

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $schema = CPAN::Testers::Schema->connect( $dsn, $user, $pass );

    # Retrieve a row
    my $row = $schema->resultset( 'TestReport' )->first;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This table contains the raw reports as submitted by the tester. From this,
the L<statistics table|CPAN::Testers::Schema::Result::Stats> is generated
by L<CPAN::Testers::Backend::ProcessReports>.

__PACKAGE__->load_components('InflateColumn::DateTime', 'Core');

=attr id

The UUID of this report stored in standard hex string representation.

=cut

primary_column 'id', {
    data_type => 'char',
    size => 36,
    is_nullable => 0,
};

=attr created

The ISO8601 date/time of when the report was inserted into the database.
Will default to the current time.

The JSON report also contains a C<created> field. This is the date/time
that the report was created on the reporter's machine.

=cut

column created => {
    data_type => 'datetime',
    is_nullable => 0,
    format_datetime => 1,
};

=attr report

The full JSON report.

XXX: Describe the format a little and link to the main schema OpenAPI
format on http://api.cpantesters.org

The serializer for this column will convert UTF-8 characters into their
corresponding C<\u####> escape sequence, so this column is safe for
tables with Latin1 encoding.

    data_type            => 'JSON',
    is_nullable          => 0,

} );

=method new

Create a new object. This is called automatically by the ResultSet
object and should not be called directly.

This is overridden to provide sane defaults for the C<id> and C<created>
fields.

B<NOTE:> You should not supply a C<created> unless you are creating
reports in the past. Reports created in the past will be hidden from
many feeds, and may cause failures to not be reported to authors.
