=head1 DESCRIPTION

This table stores the latest version of a dist that was uploaded by an
author. This information is used to build author pages.

This table is a cache of information already found in the C<uploads>
table. See L<CPAN::Testers::Schema::Result::Upload>.

This data is generated by L<CPAN::Testers::Data::Uploads>.

B<XXX>: This table violates 3NF. If we want to continue doing so, we need
to have a good reason. Remove this note when we find that reason, or else
remove this module/table entirely.
